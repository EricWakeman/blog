Using a pseudo class like hover or active are useful in correcting direct feedback with the user. Specificity is the value assigned to each individual CSS declaration which determines which declarations may take precedence over others should multiple declarations be assigned to the same target. Utilizing specificity is important for ensuring the intended declaration is executed when the code is run. Using the “!important” can heighten a declaration’s specificity beyond the point of being overwritten. A declaration that cannot be overwritten becomes less versatile in execution and may need to be fully rewritten if it’s function needs to change.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=a.exports}}]);
